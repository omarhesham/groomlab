"""The standalone app beside the Maya benchmark: one table per strand count.

The app's numbers come from its test executable's benchmark (tests/hosts/app/bench_app.cpp: the
bench's head, bend, guides and graph rebuilt without Maya, timed through GroomDocument), written
as JSON when GROOMLAB_APP_BENCH names the file:

    set GROOMLAB_APP_BENCH=results\\2026-10-02_app_exports.json
    build\\wt\\hosts\\app\\RelWithDebInfo\\groomlab_app_tests.exe --gtest_filter=AppBench.*

Then:

    python tools/bench/xgen_compare/app_exports_vs_maya.py results/2026-10-02_groomlab_5e8bc26.json \\
        results/2026-10-02_app_exports.json results/2026-10-02_app_exports_vs_maya.md

Maya is never re-run here: its medians (of 3 runs, min-max in brackets) are read from its results
JSON as run_bench.py wrote them. The app's are one run each.
