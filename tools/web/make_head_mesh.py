"""The website's 3D head (web/public/samples/manny_head.bin): the Manny sample head as a tiny binary.

    python tools/web/make_head_mesh.py

Reads hosts/maya/meshes/manny_head.obj (CC BY 4.0, "Manny head by Nick Rutlinh (GroomLab), CC BY 4.0")
and writes its subdivision cage, quantized: the page subdivides it (Catmull-Clark, in
web/components/home/head-mesh.ts) and grows the hair on its scalp. Little endian:

    char[4]  "GLHM"
    uint16   version (1)
    uint16   vertex count
    uint16   face count
    uint16   reserved (0)
    float32  centimetres per unit of the quantized positions
    int16    x, y, z per vertex (centimetres / scale; y up, facing +z)
    uint16   4 vertex indices per face (a triangle's 4th is 65535)

Deterministic: the same OBJ always writes the same bytes. No dependencies.
