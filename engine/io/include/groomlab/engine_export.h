// A groom written for a game engine's hair importer, frame by frame, as every host writes it
// (Maya's groomLabExportAlembic -unreal / -unity, the standalone app's Export panel): Unreal's
// groom (UnrealGroomWriter: the strands, the primary guides it simulates, groom groups) or
// Unity's hair package (AlembicCurvesWriter: UVs per point, every root width above 0, a curves
// object per groom group of at most its strand limit). One options struct, so a host cannot
// leave an option out.
//
// Each frame's strands are made lighter (thinBarbs: fewer, wider barbs) and lose the feathers'
// shafts when those are geometry (a rachis mesh: hasRachis), then split into groom groups by a
// channel (splitGroomGroups, featherGroupNames naming the feather groups). Unreal: the hair's
// first group simulates on the primary guides, and with featherGuides a feather group on its
// shafts. Unity: each group its own curves object, a feather group's strands resampled to
// barbPoints.
