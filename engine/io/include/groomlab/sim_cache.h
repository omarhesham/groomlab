// A simulation baked to a file: a Simulate node's frames (GroomSession's cache, simulation.h)
// as an Alembic guide cache, and read back as a bake the session takes (BakedSimulation). The
// workflow every host documents: simulate, bake to a cache, render (the groom file names the
// bake, "simCaches", so the Arnold procedural, the CLI and a farm read the baked frames rather
// than simulating again).
//
// The file is the guide caches' layout (AlembicCurvesWriter): one curves object, a curve per
// guide with its ID as "strandId", world space, a sample per frame at framesPerSecond. Maya's
// nHair guide caches have it too, so either reads as a guide cache elsewhere. A wet simulation
// (water or rain) adds its "wetness" per vertex, read back as the guides' wetness layer.
