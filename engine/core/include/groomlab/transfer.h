// Moving a groom to another scalp (GH-8): a new sculpt, a retopologized head, another
// character. Guides, parts and flow arrows are re-rooted on the new scalp; attribute layers ride
// with the guides. Painted scalp maps are projected (scalp_paint.h: projectVertexMap,
// projectTexture).
//
// Where a point of the old scalp lands is a ScalpMapping, built by one of five methods
// (TransferMethod):
//   closest       the closest point of the new scalp to the old point, as it is.
//   bounds        the old scalp's bounding box moved and scaled (uniformly) onto the new one's
//                 first (ScalpFit::boundingBoxes), then the closest point.
//   markersAlign  marker pairs (a point of the old scalp and the matching point of the new one,
//                 3 or more, not on one line) give the similarity (rotation, uniform scale,
//                 translation) that best takes the old markers onto the new ones by least squares
//                 (Horn's closed form with Umeyama's scale), then the closest point.
//   markersWarp   the marker pairs (4 or more, not on one plane) drive a smooth warp of space: a
//                 polyharmonic spline (kernel r^3, the 3D thin-plate-like spline that is smooth at
//                 its centers) plus an affine part, fitted so each old marker lands on its new one
//                 (up to a small smoothing term, kWarpSmoothing), then the closest point. Fewer or
//                 coplanar markers fall back to markersAlign with a warning.
//   uv            both scalps laid out alike in UV: each old point's UV found on the new scalp
//                 (no UV match: the closest point, counted in the warnings).
//
// For every method but closest a guide's shape (its points about its root) is carried by the
// mapping's local linear part at the root (MappedPoint::rotation and scale): the similarity's for
// align, the warp's Jacobian orthonormalized into a rotation times a uniform scale (its polar
// decomposition: guides turn and scale, they never shear) for warp, the change between the two
// scalps' UV tangent frames for uv (the scale from the ratio of their UV densities). closest and
// bounds turn shapes by the least rotation between the normals, as they always did.
