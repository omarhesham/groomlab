// Feathers for game engines, the way Weta built the eagle of Unreal's "Meerkat" short: each
// feather's shaft (the rachis) is mesh geometry skinned into the character's skeletal mesh,
// and its barbs are groom strands rooted on that mesh, so Unreal's skinning binding carries
// them with it.
//
// A Propagate node with a shaftWidth above 0 records its shafts as rachis tubes (a
// FeatherLayer on its output strands, riding along to the groom's output like card layers),
// and roots every barb on the tube's surface. buildRachisMesh turns the layers into one mesh:
// the host shows it (groomLabShape's outRachis) and exports it for skinning.
