// Compound nodes (docs/CUSTOM_NODES.md, phase 1): a compound saved as one `.glnode` file (JSON) and
// listed in every host's Add Node menu as a node of its own. Every host reads the files through
// this: Maya's Graph Editor (groomlab.nodes), the standalone app's node graph, Blender's helper.
//
// The file (format 1):
//   {"glnode": 1, "id": "nick.soft_frizz", "version": 2, "label": "Soft Frizz",
//    "category": "look", "description": "...", "author": "...", "license": "...", "icon": "",
//    "size": 20,                                       (optional: the scalp size it was made on)
//    "inputs": [{"name": "strands", "type": "Strands"}],
//    "output": {"name": "out", "type": "Strands"},
//    "params": [{"name": "amount", "target": "noise.amplitude", "label": "Amount", "default": 0.05,
//                "min": 0, "softMax": 1, "unit": "length", "mappable": true, "description": "..."}],
//    "graph": {<the compound's subgraph: graph_io.h's schema, Input nodes for the inputs>}}
//
// A node added from the library is a Compound whose "definition" is the file's content (checked,
// with its params' "expose" map and their defaults set on the inner nodes): the groom carries its
// own copy, so it opens and renders anywhere without the library (Arnold, RenderMan, the CLI) and
// keeps its look when the library's copy changes. A library copy with a higher "version" makes
// GraphEdit::nodeSpecJson say "updateAvailable"; GraphEdit::updateLibraryNode takes it (never by
// itself). A library node whose copy cannot be read (a node of an unknown type inside, none
// embedded) hands its first input on, with a note saying why: a groom never fails to open by it.
//
// The library: every folder on GROOMLAB_NODE_PATH (the OS path separator between them), the
// user's folder (nodeUserDir: Documents/GroomLab/nodes, shared by every host), then the folder
// shipped with the host (setShippedNodeDir). A file in an earlier folder hides one with the same
// id in a later one.

// Script nodes (phase 2, script.h): the same header with params as real specs, what the script
// writes and the script itself in place of "graph":
//   {"glnode": 1, "id": "nick.wave", "version": 1, "label": "Wave", "category": "shape", ...,
//    "inputs": [{"name": "strands", "type": "Strands"}, {"name": "guides", "type": "Guides",
//                "optional": true}],                     (strands first; guides for guidePoint)
//    "output": {"name": "out", "type": "Strands"},
//    "params": [{"name": "amplitude", "type": "length", "label": "Amplitude", "default": 0.3,
//                "min": 0, "softMax": 2, "mappable": true, "description": "..."}],
//    "writes": ["P"],                                    (P, width, color, channel.<name>)
//    "script": "per point { P += ...; }"}
// A param's "type": number (its "unit" optional: length, width, fraction, angle...), length,
// int, bool, enum (with "choices"; the script reads the choice's index), color (a vector) or
// ramp (read as $name(x); its default [[position, value], ...]). "mappable" (number, length):
// a map, an expression or a field drives it per strand or per point. A node added from the
// library is a Script node (graph op "Script") holding the checked file as its "definition";
// a groom carries it as it carries a compound node's copy.
