// Following the scalp (GroomSession::setFollowScalp, a groom's followScalp): the groom is
// evaluated on the scalp's rest pose and each strand is then carried to the scalp as it is now
// by the rigid motion of its root's frame.
//
// A root's frame on a scalp: its origin is the root's position, its axes one edge of the root's
// face (the longest on the rest pose, so a sliver's short edge never steers it) made
// perpendicular to the normal (x), the smooth normal at the root's barycentrics (y) and their
// cross product (z). A point p carried from scalp `from` to scalp `to` (the same topology, other
// points; the same edge on both) is
//     to.origin + to.axes * (from.axes^T * (p - from.origin)),
// a rotation and a translation: no scale, so a strand keeps its rest shape and length however
// the skin under it stretches (only its root's place and turn follow). A root whose frame is
// the same on both scalps (that part did not move) keeps its points to the bit.
