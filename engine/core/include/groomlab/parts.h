// Parting (like the parts in an animal's fur): lines on the scalp that hair
// does not mix across. Interpolate and Clump skip guides and clump centers
// on the other side of a part, and the Part operator opens the gap.
//
// Parts are stored bound to the scalp (face + barycentric coordinates per
// point, like guide roots), so they follow a deforming scalp, travel in
// groom files and transfer with the groom to a new scalp. The scalp they are
// bound to is the cage (the scalp before the Scalp node subdivides it), so the
// subdivision level can change under them (PartSet::onRefined).
//
// Sides are measured on the rest pose (stable while the scalp deforms): a
// point's side is the sign of its offset across the part at the nearest
// point on the line. Points whose nearest point is a line's end have no
// side, so hair flows around the end of a part.

// ---- Auto parts, found where the hair splits (the Part node's partsFrom auto) ----------------------------
//
// The lines where `strands` part on `scalp`: where the hair on either side of a line flows away
// from it, as a parting does. Named auto1, auto2... in the order found, bound to `scalp` as drawn
// parts are, so PartLines and the Part node open them exactly as painted ones.
//
// The flow is the strands' own: each strand's first segment laid on the scalp's tangent plane at
// its root (a strand standing straight up counts for little), so it is the hair as the node takes
// it, however it was made (guides interpolated, a Flow node along painted arrows, brushes).
//  1. Each strand's direction is spread to its root triangle's corners (barycentric weights), and
//     the vertices' sums are gathered into small cells of the scalp (an eighth of the radius R).
//  2. The field at every vertex is the cells' sums within R, weighted (1 - d^2/R^2)^2 and by how
//     much their normals face the vertex's, laid on its tangent plane: smooth, so a small edit of
//     the hair moves it a little. R is 5% of the scalp's size (the square root of its area), at
//     least 3 root spacings of the strands (few strands: guides taken directly).
//  3. An edge (i, j) of the scalp parts where the field along it turns from pointing back to i to
//     pointing on to j (d_i . (p_i - p_j) > 0 and d_j . (p_j - p_i) > 0: the discrete divergence
//     ridge, one edge wide however smooth the field; the part crosses the edge where the field's
//     component along it is zero, linearly between its ends) and the split there is sharp: the
//     hair within R on either side of that crossing (cells beyond the plane through it, across the
//     edge, leaving out a band of R/4 each side of it, too near to tell) flows away from it on
//     both sides, coherently (each side's mean direction at least 0.2 long), with at least
//     `splitAngleDegrees` between the two sides' mean directions, and some hair lies within R/2
//     of it (a part stops near the hair's edge).
//  4. Split edges are joined where their crossings are within R/2 (or 1.5 edge lengths, on a
//     coarse scalp); in each joined set the longest path (two sweeps of shortest paths) is a
//     part, the split edges joined to it dropped, until what is left is shorter than `minLength`
//     (a share of the scalp's size). A whorl's center splits over a few edges only.
//  5. Each part is resampled every R/2 and smoothed (four passes of 1/4, 1/2, 1/4, the ends kept),
//     then bound to the scalp's closest points.
// The radius is the whole scalp's: a small patch of hair on a big scalp (a head's on a body) is
// smoothed at the big scalp's scale. Parts closer together than about R merge.
// Pure and deterministic: the same strands and scalp give the same parts, at any thread count,
// and k times as big a groom gives the same parts k times as big. Empty without strands rooted on
// the scalp or without a split.
