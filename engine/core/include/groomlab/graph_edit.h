// Edits of a graph's JSON (graph_io.h's schema) as every host's node editor makes them: Maya's
// Graph Editor (the Python GraphModel, groomlab/graph.py) and the standalone app's node graph.
// The JSON is edited as it is written: every field a node has (its params, paramInputs,
// paramControls, bypass, "ui" position, anything a host added) is kept, and a graph that does
// not load yet (an input unconnected, no output) can still be edited.
//
// A node's ports come from its operator's spec (operatorSpecsJson), except that a Compound's
// come from its definition (its inputs, its inner output's type, its exposed params), an Input's
// output type from its "type" param, and every param in "paramInputs" adds a Field port (a
// Curve port for a ramp). A connection's types must fit (portTypesMatch on the output's type as
// connected: a Curves output gives what feeds it) and may not make a cycle.
