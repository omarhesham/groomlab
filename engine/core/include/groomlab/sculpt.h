// Sculpt nodes: brush strokes on guides the graph made (Houdini's guide levels: sparse hand guides
// -> Scatter + Interpolate -> ToGuides -> Sculpt -> the next Interpolate, Clump centers...). The
// strokes are kept inside the groom, keyed by the node's name ("sculpts", GroomData::sculptsJson),
// and per guide by its ID, so they follow the guides when the graph above makes them again.
//
// An edit is kept as a relative form, not as positions: for each segment of the guide as the node
// was fed it, the turn that takes the segment's direction to the sculpted one, in the segment's
// own rotation-minimizing frame, and the segment's length factor, both at the segment's middle by
// normalized arc length t (0 root, 1 tip). Reconstruction walks the guide fed now from its root:
// each segment turned by the edit's turn at its t (read between the recorded samples) in its own
// frame, and scaled. So when what feeds the node changes (the sparse guides combed, a Noise added,
// the guides longer or with other point counts), the sculpt adds the same bends on top of the new
// shapes: a 30 degree hook near the tip stays a 30 degree hook, lengths stay what they were but
// where the sculpt scaled them, and nothing snaps back to old positions.
//
// The frames: the root frame is the scalp's surface frame at the guide's root (its normal and the
// root face's first edge, as guide_hierarchy.cpp's rootFrame) turned by the minimal rotation that
// takes the normal onto the first segment (defined for any direction but straight into the
// scalp), then carried segment to segment by the minimal rotation between their directions
// (discrete parallel transport: rotation-minimizing). Without a scalp (or a root off it) world +Y
// and +X stand in for the normal and the edge.
//
// Only guides a stroke touched hold an edit. IDs the graph no longer makes keep theirs, unused,
// and use them again if the ID comes back.
