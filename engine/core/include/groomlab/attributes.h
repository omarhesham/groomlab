// Attributes: the named values per strand or per point the strands carry ("channels" in the code:
// StrandSet's strand and point channels). Some nodes write them (a Clump its clumpChannel, clumpId
// by default; an Attribute node its name; a Flyaway always "flyaway"), others read them by name
// (a Curl's clumpChannel, a Clump's regionChannel, an attribute map on any mappable param). A node
// writing a name an upstream node wrote overwrites it: chained Clumps each want their own name.
//
// graphChannels reads a graph's JSON (graph_io.h's schema, as every host's node editor holds it),
// without evaluating it, and tells for each node which channels reach it (and from which node),
// which it writes, which upstream channel it overwrites, and whether each channel its params read
// reaches it. A graph that does not load yet (an input unconnected, no output) is read as it is:
// what is not connected brings nothing. What the editors show beside the channel params
// (ParamSpec::channel): "Writes"/"Reads", the channels to pick from, an overwrite warning, a note
// for a read that nothing upstream writes.
