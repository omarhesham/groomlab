// Screen-space level of detail for strand lines (docs/research/clump_lod.md): a viewport draws, per
// clump, m of its n strands, each standing for n / m of them, and a clump thinner than a pixel as
// one line along its axis. Viewport only: renders and exports never see it.
//
// The strands are grouped by their clump channel (StrandLodSettings::clumpChannel, Clump's
// clumpId), or, without one, by cells of their roots. Within a group they are ranked by the hash
// of their ID, the preview's own order (keepAtDensity): a group drawing m strands draws its first
// m, so fewer strands are always a subset of more (nothing swaps as the view zooms).
//
// A group's m comes from two rules (the research's section 1.3), each point of its axis taken at
// the pixels a scene unit spans where that point comes closest to the camera as the camera orbits
// the strands' bounding sphere at its distance (StrandLodView):
//   - coverage: the m strands, each widened to 1 - (1 - c)^(n/m) from its own coverage c (what the
//     shaders' lineCoverageAtDensity does for a thinned preview), stay below c* = 2 x the error
//     allowed (StrandLodSettings::error), where widening's bias (about half of c* relative) stays
//     within it: m >= n ln(1 - c) / ln(1 - c*), c the members' mean coverage;
//   - footprint: a group spread D pixels across needs about D lines a pixel wide to fill it.
// The share n / m is rounded down to a class, a quarter octave apart (lodClassExponent): a host
// draws each class's strands with one exponent (its shaders' density, lineDensity, divided by the
// class's exponent), so the classes are its draw calls, and a group takes round(n / exponent)
// strands, so the strands stand for the group's n exactly (to a strand).
//
// A group whose members spread less than kLodImpostorSpread pixels about its axis is drawn as one
// strand along the axis (impostors()): the members' mean point by point, as wide as the ink of
// the members as a Gaussian band of Beer-Lambert fibers (lodBandInk), in their mean color.
//
// The view is the pixels a scene unit spans at the nearest depth the strands' bounding sphere's
// center can come to as the camera orbits its pivot (the point it tumbles about: Maya's center of
// interest or tumble pivot, the app's orbit target; the sphere's center when none is given),
// quantized to eighth octaves with hysteresis (lodLevel), and the pixels it spans at clip w 1 (the
// projection and the viewport's height). An orbit keeps the camera's distance to its pivot and the
// pivot's place in the view, so the pivot's depth d stays, and the center, e from the pivot, comes
// as near as d - e and goes as far as d + e whichever way it turns; a point r from the center comes
// as near as d - e - r. So nothing comes or goes as the camera orbits, about whatever pivot, only
// as it comes nearer or goes farther, in steps. At the view drawn last a group's class keeps a
// quarter class of hysteresis, so a dab's or a tweak's moved strands change nothing; at another
// view the rules alone choose. Everything is deterministic: the same strands, settings and view
// give the same selection, whichever views came before (but the one just before, the same).
