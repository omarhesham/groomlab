// Paths along a scalp's skin, from points on it: how far each vertex lies along the surface, and
// how a direction at the point arrives there carried along it. Interpolate weighs its guides by
// these distances (followSurface) and carries their shapes along these paths (its frame
// transfer).
//
// A front from a point visits the rest pose's vertices nearest first (Dijkstra), out to a limit.
// Its distances are straight segments between the places where the path turns: a vertex takes
// the straight line from the anchor of the vertex it is reached from (the source, or a vertex
// where the path bent) while that line stays on the skin, else the path bends at that vertex.
// A line stays on the skin when it leans out of the tangent planes at both its ends by less than
// 30 degrees (one through a fold, a thin flap or across a shell leaves the surface steeply) and
// the edges the front took to get there are not much longer (it does not jump a gap or a notch
// of the mesh: an ear cut out of the scalp). So wherever the straight line hugs the skin, a
// vertex's distance is the straight line from the source, and where the skin folds away, the
// path goes round. On a convex patch the line is a chord: at the lean allowed, within 1.5% of the
// distance along the curved skin.
//
// A direction is carried from anchor to anchor by the shortest turn between their normals (along
// a straight piece on the skin, the turn parallel transport along it makes), so an end reached
// without a bend gets exactly the turn from the source's normal to its own, and one reached round
// a fold gets the turns through the bends: its twist about its normal beyond that plain turn.
//
// The mesh is welded first (vertices at one place are one: a scan split along its UV seams is
// one surface), so a seam is no edge to a path. Everything is on the rest pose, so a deforming
// scalp's paths are the same on every frame.
